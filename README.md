# Habbit the Habit Rabbit

## A rabbit that keeps you accountable!

As a student, it is a hassle to remember to do important habits
in spite of schoolwork, let alone having balance between the two.
Habit Rabbit is your very own pet Rabbit that mirrors your daily activities.
This project is special for me, and I think that this project will also help a lot of students
because seeing ourselves through a third person view will add clarity to how we are actually doing in life.
On the other hand, I do believe that I will be able to learn a lot throughout the process
of building this project simply because it involves a lot of thinking and implementation
to make this whole project works and I can't wait to learn everything from start to finish as I go.  

**"Studying is good, but as students we tend to neglect our healthy habits!"**  
Having Habit Rabbit on your desktop will keep you responsible for your own self-care and well-being
because every single habit that you do, you do it for the sake of your pet rabbit!
